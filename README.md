# README

Spoonly is a web-3.0-big-data-cloud-AI-enabled application that will take down our competitors Marley Spoon and Hello Fresh in the meal kit industry.

## Getting started

- Copy .env.test to .env.development and replace sample values with real ones
- Run `bundle install` to install gem dependencies
- Run `overcommit --install` to setup our ruby linting pre-commit hooks
- Run `bundle exec rails server` to start the server
- Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Testing

- Run the test suite with `rspec`
- If you don't have chromedriver installed, you'll need it, I suggest installing with brew on MacOS (otherwise you could try adding the `chromedriver-helper` gem)
